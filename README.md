# What is Cloud COmputing?
 * On demand delivery 
  * Storing data/application on remote servers
  * Processing data/application on remote servers
  * Accessing data/application on remote servers
  * Computer power

# Domains of AWS
1) Compute
2) Migration
3) Security & Compliance
4) Storage (Bucket)
5) Networking
6) Messaging
7) Database
8) Management tools

# AWS Services free 
1) 12 Months free and always free product
2) Compute ->Amazon EC2 -> 750 Hours
3) Analytics ->Amazon QuickSight -> 1 GB Request
4) Database -> Amazon RDS -> 750 Hours
5) Storage & Contetnt Delivery-> Amazon S3 -> 5GB
6) Compute -> AWS Lambda -> 1 Million
# What is An instance ?
* An instnace is a Virtual server for Running applications on Amazon's EC2
* It Can also be understood like a tiny part of a larger computer, a tiny part which has its own Hard drive, network connection, OS etc, but it is actually all vertual.
# What is EC2?
* Amazone Elastic Copmpute Cloud, EC2 is a web service from Amazon that provides re-sizable compute services in the cloud.
* "Scalable", "Flexible", & "Cost Efficient".
# Types of Instances
* For Applications that requre a balance of perfomance and cost, where you need a promopt response, cost effectiveness, less processing
* Compute Instances
  1) for applications that requrire a lot of processing from the CPU.
  2) if you streaming Data then compute Instances is best
* Memory Instances
  1) for applications that are heavy in nature, therefore, requrire a lot of RAM.
  2) When application need multi tasking and multi processing.
* Storage Instances
  1) for applications that are huge in size or have a data set that occupies a lot of space.
  2) Large sized application
* GPU Instnaces
  1) for applications that requrire some heavy grpahics rendering
  2) 3D modeling graphic kind of work
# EC2 Instnace Pricing Models
* On-Demand-> pricing like 1hr or 1 day bases like rent type one month rent staying
* Dedicated-> high security or which space are  use that space not shared by anyone and data reamens private
* On spot-> its good for volatile data 
* Reserved->
#  EC2 Instnace Basednon their Functioning
* Brustable
* EBS Optimised
* Cluster Networking
* Dedicated
